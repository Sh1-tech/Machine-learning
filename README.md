Hi my name is Sharifah Alyousef, I am currently a third-year student majoring in Computer Science. I have always had a passion for technology and coding, and I am particularly intereted in machine learning and how it can be used to solve real-world problems. In my spare time, I
enjoy playing chess and hiking.
